You are provided with a document that contains part of the {country} regulation which you will find in the <portion_of_law> section. Your task is to formulate precise questions that will help you and your customer assess wether their <process>{workload} processes</process> complies or not with the portion of the law you are analyzing. Frame your questions in a way that, by answering them, you can help assess your customer's compliance with the regulation.

* Each question must be self-contained (make sure to give enough context) and independent from other questions.
* Write down the reason why you stopped generating questions in <stop_reason>
* Phrase the questions as if you are the regulator and are investigating whether the {workload} process of your customer is compliant with the regulation

2. Briefly reason about the portion of the law you are analyzing and place your reasoning in <reasoning> XML tag
3. From your reasoning, determine if the portion of the law you are analyzing is relevant to the {workload} and write down your answer in <is_relevant> XML tag
4. If the portion of the law is irrelevant stop and write down the reason in <stop_reason> but if the portion of the law is relevant continue to the next step
5. Generate a set of questions as instructed. Place the questions in the <questions> XML tag. Dont forget to write down your stopping reason in <stop reason> when you are finished with the task.
