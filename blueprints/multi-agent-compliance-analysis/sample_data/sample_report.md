# 1. Cloud Provider Section

## 1.1. Overview

This section defines the cloud service(s) contracted by THE CUSTOMER, including information about the cloud provider, cloud type, service models, and geographical deployment regions. This assessment is based on the Regulation Compliance Analysis process documentation and evaluates compliance with relevant Software & Internet industry regulations in Mexico.

## 1.2. Cloud Service Provider Information

### 1.2.1. Provider Identification
#TODO: Identify the specific cloud provider(s) currently used or planned to be contracted by THE CUSTOMER. This information should be obtained from THE CUSTOMER's IT department or through review of service agreements.

### 1.2.2. Deployment Model
#TODO: Determine whether THE CUSTOMER's cloud deployment is public, private, hybrid, or multi-cloud. This architectural information is essential for evaluating security and compliance requirements under Mexican regulations.

### 1.2.3. Service Models
#TODO: Specify which cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) THE CUSTOMER is utilizing or planning to utilize. Different service models have varying compliance implications under Mexican regulations.

### 1.2.4. Geographical Distribution
#TODO: Document the specific regions or locations where cloud services are being provided. This information is critical for assessing compliance with data residency requirements under Mexican law.

## 1.3. Regulatory Compliance Assessment

### 1.3.1. Data Residency Requirements
Under Mexican regulations, particularly the Federal Law on Protection of Personal Data Held by Private Parties (LFPDPPP) and its regulations, THE CUSTOMER must comply with specific data residency requirements when utilizing cloud services. While Mexico does not have absolute data localization laws, the LFPDPPP establishes that international transfers of personal data require:

1. Informed consent from the data subject
2. Implementation of appropriate security measures
3. Ensuring the recipient provides the same level of protection as required under Mexican law

Additionally, regulated sectors such as financial services and healthcare have more stringent data residency requirements. THE CUSTOMER must ensure their cloud arrangements comply with these requirements, particularly regarding notice, consent mechanisms, and contractual safeguards for cross-border data transfers.

### 1.3.2. Service Level Agreements
#TODO: Verify whether THE CUSTOMER has documented service level agreements (SLAs) with their cloud provider(s). These SLAs should be reviewed to ensure they meet regulatory requirements and adequately protect THE CUSTOMER's interests, defining performance metrics, availability guarantees, data handling procedures, and security responsibilities.

### 1.3.3. Data Classification Assessment
#TODO: Confirm if THE CUSTOMER has conducted a data classification assessment to determine what types of data will be stored in the cloud. This assessment is critical for compliance with the LFPDPPP and its regulations, particularly for identifying sensitive personal data, financial information, and other regulated data types that require specific protection measures.

## 1.4. Security Controls Assessment

### 1.4.1. Data Encryption Implementation
#TODO: Verify whether THE CUSTOMER has implemented data encryption for data in transit and at rest in their cloud environment. This is a crucial security measure required for compliance with multiple Mexican regulations, including the LFPDPPP and sector-specific requirements.

### 1.4.2. Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
#TODO: Document what disaster recovery and business continuity plans THE CUSTOMER has in place for their cloud services. These plans should address recovery time objectives, data backup procedures, and alternative processing arrangements in compliance with applicable Mexican regulations.

### 1.4.3. Cloud Provider Security Assessment
#TODO: Determine if THE CUSTOMER has conducted a security assessment of the cloud provider's infrastructure and security controls. This assessment is required under Mexican data protection regulations, which place responsibility on data controllers to ensure that service providers implement appropriate security measures.

## 1.5. Operational Governance

### 1.5.1. Governance Requirements Evaluation
THE CUSTOMER has established processes to evaluate governance requirements before deploying changes. The company utilizes several AWS tools and methodologies for this purpose, including:

- AWS Config
- AWS CloudFormation Guard
- AWS Service Catalog
- AWS Config Rules
- AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
- AWS IAM Roles and Policies

These tools collectively provide a framework for ensuring governance requirements are assessed and met prior to deploying changes to the system.

### 1.5.2. Operational Readiness Assessment
Based on the compliance assessment, THE CUSTOMER collects operational metrics to evaluate operational readiness, but these appear limited to technical deployment metrics rather than comprehensive operational risk evaluation. Specifically, the metrics collected include:
- Region of blueprint deployment
- Name and version of the blueprint

These metrics primarily support the maintenance, development, and improvement of services and constructs, but do not constitute a complete operational risk assessment framework.

#TODO: Identify what specific plans or timelines exist for implementing a comprehensive operational risk assessment framework beyond the current technical metrics.

### 1.5.3. Personnel Capability Assurance
#TODO: Document what formal or informal processes are in place to ensure personnel capability for workload support and incident troubleshooting. The current documentation does not detail any formal training programs, certification requirements, skill assessments, or knowledge validation processes for personnel responsible for supporting the workload or responding to incidents.

### 1.5.4. Third-Party Vendor Management
#TODO: Document the current approach to managing third-party vendors, including any audit and monitoring processes to ensure compliance with relevant regulations and industry standards. The compliance documentation does not provide specific information about formalized processes for vendor management.

## 1.6. Risk Assessment

#TODO: Determine if THE CUSTOMER has conducted any risk assessment related to the gaps identified in operational readiness, personnel capability, and vendor management.
